To expand this game further, you can consider adding the following functionalities:

1. **Multiple Levels**: As of now, we have created one level. You can create multiple levels using the `Level` class, each with a different layout of bricks. You can then add functionality to proceed to the next level when all bricks in the current level are destroyed.

2. **Scoring System**: You can add a scoring system where players get points for each brick they destroy. This could be displayed in the UI using JavaFX's Text or Label controls.

3. **Lives**: You can give the player a certain number of lives. When the ball falls off the screen, they lose a life, and the game restarts from the beginning of the current level. If they lose all their lives, then it's game over.

4. **Power-ups**: Power-ups are bonuses that give the player special abilities for a limited time. They can be dropped randomly from destroyed bricks. Examples of power-ups include enlarging the paddle, adding an extra ball, or even a "laser paddle" that can destroy bricks directly.

5. **Sound Effects and Music**: Adding sound effects can make the game more engaging. You can add sounds for when the ball hits the paddle, hits a brick, when the player gains a life, loses a life, and so on.

6. **Better Collision Handling**: As of now, when the ball hits a brick, it always reverses direction. This is not how a real ball would bounce. To make the game more realistic, you could calculate the new direction of the ball based on where it hit the brick.

7. **Start Screen and Pause Menu**: Right now, the game starts immediately when you run the program. You could add a start screen with a "Play" button, and a pause menu that lets you pause the game and resume it later.

These are just a few ideas to get you started. Making a game is a complex project, but also a lot of fun. You can add as many features as you want, and make the game your own.

Remember to always test your game thoroughly. Make sure it's fun to play, and that there are no bugs or glitches that could ruin the experience for the player. Good luck, and happy coding!
